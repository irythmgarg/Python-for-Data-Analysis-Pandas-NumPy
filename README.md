Theory on Pandas and NumPy in Python
NumPy (Numerical Python)
NumPy is a powerful library in Python for numerical computing. It provides support for working with arrays, mathematical operations, and linear algebra, which are essential for scientific computing.

Key Features of NumPy
N-dimensional Array Object (ndarray):

The core feature of NumPy is its ndarray, a fast, flexible, and memory-efficient container for large datasets.
Arrays are homogeneous (all elements are of the same type).
Mathematical Operations:

Provides tools for performing element-wise and matrix-level computations efficiently.
Broadcasting:

Enables arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes.
Linear Algebra:

Supports operations like dot products, eigenvalues, matrix decompositions, and more.
Integration with Other Libraries:

Widely used in libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
Performance:

NumPy operations are much faster than traditional Python lists due to its implementation in C and support for vectorized operations.
Pandas
Pandas is a high-level data manipulation and analysis library in Python. It provides tools for working with structured data, such as tables, time-series data, and more.

Key Features of Pandas
Data Structures:

Series: A one-dimensional labeled array, similar to a column in a spreadsheet.
DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to a table in a database or an Excel spreadsheet.
Data Manipulation:

Tools for cleaning, transforming, and reshaping data.
Supports handling missing data, filtering, and conditional selections.
Indexing and Labeling:

Allows easy access to rows and columns using labels or positions.
Data Analysis:

Built-in functions for summarizing data (e.g., mean, median, mode).
Grouping and aggregating data for deeper analysis.
Data Integration:

Supports reading from and writing to various formats like CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and JSON.
Time-Series Analysis:

Specialized tools for handling time-indexed data, resampling, and frequency conversions.
Integration:

Works seamlessly with NumPy, Matplotlib, and other Python libraries.


Applications
NumPy:

Numerical simulations.
Data preprocessing.
Machine learning (e.g., tensor operations).
Pandas:

Data wrangling and exploration.
Statistical modeling.
Preparing datasets for machine learning.
Both NumPy and Pandas are essential for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing, providing complementary capabilities that make Python a dominant tool in these fields.
